A *Binary Tree* is a data structure designed for representing hierarchical data. Each `node` can contain a max of two `child nodes` (left & right) *Binary Search [Trees](Trees.md)* are sorted alphanumerically so they can be traversed using a *Binary Search algorithm,* also known as *Divide and Conquer.*
```


## Binary Search Tree:
- Each node can have a max of 2 children/leaves
- The left child node is always a lower value than its parent node
- The right child node is always a greater value than its parent node
		*left child < node < right child*

- Insert(x) [O (log n) - Logarithmic Time](Time%20Complexity%20-%20Big%20O%20Notation.md#O%20log%20n%20-%20Logarithmic%20Time)
