*Breadth First Traversal*, also known as *Level Order Traversal*, is method of traversing a Tree data structure where each node is read level by level. 
```

##### Breadth First/ Level Order
- Start by reading the root node
- Next, read each child node
- Then, each child node again, etc.

`output: [7, 4, 9, 1, 6, 8, 10]`
