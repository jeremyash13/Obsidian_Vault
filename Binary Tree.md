A Binary Tree is a data structure designed for representing hierarchical data. Binary [Trees](Trees.md) are sorted alphanumerically so they can be traversed using a Binary Search algorithm, also known as Divide and Conquer.

- Each node can have a max of 2 children/leaves
- The left child node is always a lower value than its parent node
- The right child node is always a greater value than its parent node
		*left child < node < right child*
