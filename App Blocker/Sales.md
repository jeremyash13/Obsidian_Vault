Pick a very niched-down customer. e.g. instead of making a "Time Management" product, make a Time Management product for salesman (niching-down as far as possible) who does outbound sales for a gardening tools company.

The goal is to make the prospect (and their problems) feel understood, in order to get them to make a purchase. *This is the key to persuasionâ€”to make the prospect feel understood.* The more you can articulate their problems and their reality to them, the more they will be willing to purchase the product.
