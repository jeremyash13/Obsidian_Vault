# Features

- Block .exe's (block all in a folder, such as steam library, or select 1 by 1)
- block websites (probably by altering HOSTS file) or by using a custom browser extension
	- need admin privileges to alter HOSTS file
- block for a timed duration
- block on a schedule
- block until restart
- block until a password is entered
- ==MAYBE== add an option to *pay a ransom* to release the block! ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘
- option to enable *Distraction Free* YouTube
	- instead of blocking YT, block all suggested video feeds. so YT *search* can still be used as a learning resource and the user cant get sucked down rabbit holes
	- ability to modify *Distraction Free YT* as to only show recommendations from "productive" sources. (will need to research the YouTube API to find out if this is worth the effort)
		- e.g. if you are a software developer, only show recommendations from the developer category.
- NETWORK controlled blocking
	- a device using an "Admin" account can dictate blocking policy for all devices on the local network
