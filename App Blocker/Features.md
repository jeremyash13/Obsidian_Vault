# Features 

#### General
- Block .exe's (block all in a folder, such as steam library, or select 1 by 1)
- block websites (probably by altering HOSTS file) or by using a custom browser extension
	- need admin privileges to alter HOSTS file
- block for a timed duration
- block on a schedule
- block until restart
- block until a password is entered
- ==MAYBE== add an option to *pay a ransom* to release the block! ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘
- option to enable *Distraction Free* YouTube
	- instead of blocking YT, block all suggested video feeds. so YT *search* can still be used as a learning resource and the user cant get sucked down rabbit holes
- NETWORK controlled blocking
	- a device using an "Admin" account can dictate blocking policy for all devices on the local network

#### Installation:
- auto detect all browsers on machine
- walk user through installing the browser extension, 1 browser at a time.

#### Licensing:
- $34.99 for a single lifetime license,  +$9.99 to extend the license to each additional device.
- app will run a separate service for monitoring license status (that way if the user attempts to block internet traffic to/from the app, the licensing can still be validated)

#### Blocker Defense System:

###### Defending browser extension uninstalls:
- Method 1: Keep a *secret* backup of browser extension folder, watch browser extension folder for changes, automatically restore missing files from secret backup.  ==Need to test this==
