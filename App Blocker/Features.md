# Features 
---

#### General:
- all blocking to be carried out by a service to be running in the background
	- the GUI will instruct the service to activate/deactivate 

#### App Blocking:
- Block .exe's (block all in a folder, such as steam library, or select 1 by 1)
	- recursively search a selected folder for .exe's, write the filenames to an encrypted block list on hard drive
		- re-do the recursive search on block activation, incase file names have changed
		- somehow find a way to cause the folder to "be in use" so the folder cannot be renamed or moved while the block is active
			- alternatively, add the folder itself to some sort of list to be tracked, hook into system events and watch for changes to this folder, try to intercept actions.

#### Website Blocking:
- Create a browser extension that blocks sites
- renders a custom page when visiting a blocked site
- have a few prepared lists of well known distracting and harmful sites to choose from
- can create your own custom block list and/or extend a premade list
- option to enable *Distraction Free* YouTube
	- instead of blocking YT, block all suggested video feeds. so YT *search* can still be used as a learning resource, but the user cant get sucked down rabbit holes

#### Blocking Policies:
- block for a timed duration
- block on a schedule
- block until restart
- block until a password is entered
- ==MAYBE== add an option to *pay a ransom* to release the block! ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘
- Block waits until to become active

#### Remote Blocking Controls (parental controls):
- a device using an "Admin" account can dictate blocking policy for all devices on the local network
- Indefinite blocks where permission to access a blocked item has to be granted by an admin.
	- slave device requests permission, a notification is sent to parent, access is approved/denied. 

#### List of warnings to users who try to bypass block:
- DO NOT uninstall browser extensions while block is active
	- All browsers will be blocked for the duration of the block

#### Installation:
- auto detect all browsers on machine
- walk user through installing the browser extension, 1 browser at a time.

#### Licensing:
- $34.99 for a single lifetime license,  +$9.99 to extend the license to each additional device.
- app will run a separate service for monitoring license status (that way if the user attempts to block internet traffic to/from the app, the licensing can still be validated)
- upon purchase, will be granted a serial # to enter into the software
- licensing can be managed through website (adding new licenses, activating/deactivating serials tied to devices)

#### Blocker Defense System:

###### Defending browser extension uninstalls:
- Method 1: Keep a *secret* backup of browser extension folder, watch browser extension folder for changes, automatically restore missing files from secret backup.
