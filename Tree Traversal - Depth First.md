*Depth First Traversal*, is method of traversing a Tree data structure where each node is read ....
```

### Pre-Order Traversal
Tree is traversed and read in the order of: `*Root*, Left, Right`

### In-Order Traversal
Tree is traversed and read in the order of: `Left, *Root*, Right`

### Post-Order Traversal
Tree is traversed and read in the order of: `Left, Right, *Root*`
